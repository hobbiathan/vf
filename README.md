# Voidflowers

The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/hobbiathan/voidflowers/).

Rewritten with Ruby 3.0.3 and Rails 7.0.4

Nothing functionally is too different, but the original repository felt like a much greater mess than I wanted to deal with, so I'm just recreating the application. That being said, this app was built without a bunch of the normally preinstalled gems and packages that come with a default app (turbolinks, hotwire, etc...) making it much more lightweight. That, and I didn't commit my master key or UNIQ key to the repository this time.
